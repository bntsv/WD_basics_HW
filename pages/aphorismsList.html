        <p class="dark">“I feel a lot of people listen to what I have to say.”</p>
        <p>“I’ll drink water. Sometimes tomato juice, which I like. Sometimes orange juice, which I like. I’ll drink different things. But the Coke or Pepsi boosts you up a little.”</p>
        <p class="dark">“We need a great president.”</p>
        <p>“Owning a great golf course gives you great power.”</p>
        <p class="dark">“I’ve always won, and I’m going to continue to win. And that’s the way it is.”</p>
        <p>“I was a great student. I was good at everything.”</p>
        <p class="dark">“It’s always good to be underestimated.”</p>
        <p>“Sometimes your best investments are the ones you don’t make.”</p>
